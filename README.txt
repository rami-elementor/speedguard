No need to guess whether your website performance needs your attention or not - you will get the definite answer in your WordPress Dashboard in a few minutes.

== With SpeedGuard you get: ==

* <strong>Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) testing for individual URLs of your website</strong>
* <strong>PageSpeed Insights (LCP, CLS) for the cases if your website doesn't have Core Web Vitals yet</strong>
* <strong>automatic </strong> everyday monitoring
* <strong>both desktop and mobile</strong> testing
* <strong>links to the Google PageSpeed Insights reports (that include CWV on top as well)</strong> which you can pass to the performance engineer to improve your site speed
* <strong>tests are completely automated</strong> -- you don't need to do anything
* <strong>easy to use</strong> â€” just pick pages of your website that you would like to monitor
* <strong>It's free :)</strong>



== Test performance of any  content in WordPress :==

= Idea Behind =
There is no need to say that performance IS very important.
What's also important -- is to understand whether you have to worry about your website performance or it's doing fine.

Google Core Web Vitals are the metrics that Google uses to measure the user experience on the web (real user experience!).

If your website passes CWV assessment for Origin -- it means that your website is fast enough for the majority of users.
If it doesn't pass -- it means that you have to fix this.
If it does pass but quite a few specific URLs are not passing -- it's a good time to look into those URLs and improve them to prevent the entrire webstie to be marked as failing CWV.

I wanted a simple easy-to-use tool to warn me in case my clients' websites performance has a bad tendency and needs my attention.

I wanted a native WordPress solution, with all information available from the dashboard, simple but still informative, a guard who will do the monitoring every day and ping me, in case something goes wrong.

I have not found one and that's why I've built this plugin.

I'll be happy to know that you find it useful as well -- please, leave a review.

P.S. Note about PageSpeed Insights: you SHOULD always use CWV data in case it is available for your website. In case it is not available (when the website is new and/or doesn't have enough traffic yet) -- use PageSpeed Insights. But you have to remember, that PSI -- are lab tests, it's just an emulation of real users experience. It's better than nothing, of course.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How tests are performed? =
Starting from version 1.7 SpeedGuard is using [Google PageSpeed Insights API](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) which uses [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) technology to perform tests.
From there we have Core Web Vitals data for specific URLs of your website and for origin. (Same data, that you can see in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) under Core Web Vitals section.)

= Do I need Google PageSpeed Insights API key to use SpeedGuard? =
No, you don't. Just add pages you need to test.

= Are the tests results for desktop or mobile users? =
For both. Automatically.

= Is it compatible with WordPress Multisite? =
Use per-site activation.

= Where can I suggest a new feature or report a bug? =
Here, in the support forum.
